## About the Game
**Eco-Quest** is a text-based survival game designed to raise awareness about **sustainable living**.  
It is inspired by the console-based game *World of Zuul* and the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #12: Responsible Consumption and Production**.

## Story
You wake up stranded on a **deserted island**.  
Your goal is simple: **survive** and **find a way back home**.

Each day, new resources wash up on the shore — materials you can collect to craft tools, build shelters, and ultimately construct a **boat to escape** the island.

But every material has environmental consequences.  
Plastic, metal, and cardboard may help you survive in the short term, but they also impact the island’s fragile ecosystem.  
Your survival depends on balancing **resource use**, **sustainability**, and **time**.

Can you make it off the island — or will your own choices lead to your downfall?

## Gameplay Overview
- Explore the island and collect materials.  
- Craft tools, build shelters, and repair damaged structures.  
- Manage your time, food and resources each day.  
- Choose wisely which materials to use... every decision affects the environment.
